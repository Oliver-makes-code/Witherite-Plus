# Warning
Unfortunately, I do not have enough time to update and maintain this mod, so, unfortunately, its development by me stops here. The latest version of the mod is available for 1.17.1 and can be downloaded from Modrinth. If you are a developer and wish to continue working on a mod, then I give full rights to fork this mod and publish it on Modrinth/Curseforge on your behalf.

# Witherite
Witerite is a new, stronger and better material than Netherite. Items made from this material have greater strength, power and efficiency.
